### halo everyone :3
my name is kamasuto, i'm a little interested in projects like some **android projects**, and i'm also interested in **python** in some sense

### devices
```
google pixel 6 | 8/128, main
google pixel 3 | 4/64, the second, serves as a test machine
```
### pc
```
kmst@pc | sudo rm -rf /*
```
### active projects
```
silikon - my first program that is somehow related to android,
and not just some simple and stupid program, but a pretty good program that in
theory can compete with dev-check
```
